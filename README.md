# medical-handwritten-prescription-reader-llm
A vision language model-powered GUI application to read medical handwritten prescriptions

* Make sure to have an API key for the vision language model being used (Gemini 2.5 Flash in this case) and store it in a python file 'api_keys.py'
* If a local LLM like Gemini 3 4B is to be used as the corrector LLM, have LMStudio installed locally and download the corresponding model
